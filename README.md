# `go-fdo-ci`

Shared CI test repository for [`go-fdo-server`](https://github.com/fido-device-onboard/go-fdo-server) and [`go-fdo-client`](https://github.com/fido-device-onboard/go-fdo-client).

Contains all FMF test plans, test metadata, and test scripts. Packit test jobs in both source repos reference this repo via `fmf_url` so the same test definitions drive CI for both projects.

#### `test/container/` — Container-Based E2E Tests

> These scripts use `${COMPOSE_DIR}` (default: `deployments/compose`) to locate compose files. That directory stays in `go-fdo-server`. GitHub Actions must checkout `go-fdo-server` alongside `go-fdo-ci` when running container tests.

## Notes on Changes

### Why the Coordinated Plan Uses Absolute Paths

`coordinated-e2e.fmf` clones both repos into `/var/tmp/fdo/server` and `/var/tmp/fdo/client` and sets `SERVER_LOCAL_PATH`/`CLIENT_LOCAL_PATH` to those absolute paths. Relative paths (e.g., `server`, `client`) would not work because tmt runs each test script from the test's own directory (`test/fmf/tests/`), not from the directory where the `prepare:` step ran. Absolute paths are the only safe option for cross-step path sharing in tmt.

The `SERVER_REF` and `CLIENT_REF` environment variables control which commit each repo is checked out to; both default to `main`.

### Why Filters Use Compound Expressions

The `go-fdo-ci` FMF tree contains all 8 tests from both repos. Simple single-tag filters that worked in each repo's narrow local tree become too broad in the combined tree — for example, `tag:e2e` would match 7 tests instead of 2 after migration. All tests are tagged `client` or `server` to allow unambiguous compound filters (`tag:e2e & tag:client`).

### Why `fdo-utils.sh` Was Renamed Twice

Both repos had a file named `fdo-utils.sh` with completely different contents:
- Server's `scripts/fdo-utils.sh` — REST API helpers (get/set RV info, upload OVs, trigger TO0)
- Client's `.github/scripts/fdo-utils.sh` — cert generation and test environment setup

Merging both into `test/scripts/` required renaming to avoid collision:
- Server's → `server-api-utils.sh`
- Client's → `client-test-utils.sh`

### Why `test-bootc-onboarding.sh` Moved

The client stored its bootc test script alongside FMF metadata in `test/fmf/tests/`. In `go-fdo-ci`, bootc scripts live in `test/bootc/` alongside the server's bootc scripts. The `bootc-onboarding.fmf` metadata was updated to reflect the new path.

### What Stayed in `go-fdo-server` (Not Moved)

`deployments/compose/` — Docker Compose files used by `test/container/` scripts. These scripts locate the compose files via the `COMPOSE_DIR` environment variable (default: `deployments/compose`). For GitHub Actions, the simplest layout is to checkout `go-fdo-server` at the workspace root so the default path works. Alternatively, set `COMPOSE_DIR` to match the actual checkout layout (e.g., `COMPOSE_DIR=server/deployments/compose`).
